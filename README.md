Spotify Playlist Analyzer

Users log-in using their spotify credentials and then get access to all their playlists via Spotify's web API. They then can choose a playlist to have analyzed. Analysis 
uses Spotify's web API to get values for each song and then provide an average value for the playlist as whole. 

Backend is built using Python's Django framework. Graphs are created using d3.js. Bootstrap is used to style the project.
